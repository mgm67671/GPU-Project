Overview
The optimized Sobel kernel, which uses shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, is slower than the naive kernel on the current system, even when tested with a large image (95.5 MB). This behavior is unexpected, especially given that the system is equipped with high-performance NVIDIA GPUs. Below, we analyze the reasons for this performance discrepancy.

Key Findings
Shared Memory Overhead:

The optimized kernel uses 16.38 KB of shared memory per block, which introduces additional instructions to load data into shared memory.
Synchronization (__syncthreads()) is required to ensure all threads in a block finish loading shared memory before computation begins. This adds significant latency, especially for large workloads.
Efficient Global Memory Access in Naive Kernel:

The naive kernel accesses global memory directly, and its memory accesses are coalesced, minimizing the performance penalty for global memory latency.
On modern NVIDIA GPUs with high memory bandwidth and low latency, the naive kernel benefits from the hardware's ability to handle global memory efficiently.
Compute-Bound Workload:

The workload appears to be compute-bound, meaning the bottleneck is in computation rather than memory.
The optimized kernel reduces memory traffic but does not address the computational bottleneck, leading to no significant performance improvement.
High Achieved Occupancy:

The optimized kernel achieves higher occupancy (91.16%) compared to the naive kernel (79.59%). However, higher occupancy does not always translate to better performance if the kernel is limited by other factors, such as instruction throughput or synchronization overhead.
Synchronization Costs:

The optimized kernel relies on __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block. For large images, this synchronization overhead accumulates and outweighs the benefits of reduced global memory accesses.
GPU Characteristics:

The system's NVIDIA GPU likely has high memory bandwidth and low latency, making global memory accesses less of a bottleneck.
The naive kernel's simplicity allows it to take full advantage of the GPU's hardware capabilities without introducing additional overhead.
Why the Optimized Kernel Might Be Slower
Modern GPU Efficiency:

Modern NVIDIA GPUs are designed to handle global memory accesses efficiently, especially when memory accesses are coalesced. The naive kernel benefits from this hardware optimization.
Overhead of Shared Memory:

While shared memory reduces global memory accesses, it introduces additional overhead for loading data and synchronizing threads. This overhead becomes significant for large workloads.
Mismatch Between Optimization and Bottleneck:

The optimization focuses on reducing memory traffic, but the workload is compute-bound. As a result, the optimized kernel does not address the actual bottleneck.
Instruction Throughput:

The optimized kernel has more instructions due to shared memory management, which increases the kernel's execution time.
Recommendations
Reevaluate Shared Memory Usage:

Reduce the shared memory tile size to minimize overhead.
Avoid loading unnecessary border pixels into shared memory.
Minimize Synchronization:

Use warp-level primitives (e.g., __shfl_sync) to share data between threads within a warp, reducing the need for __syncthreads().
Hybrid Approach:

Use the naive kernel for compute-bound workloads and the optimized kernel for memory-bound workloads.
Test with Memory-Bound Workloads:

Test the optimized kernel with workloads that are memory-bound to evaluate its performance in scenarios where memory traffic is the bottleneck.
Conclusion
The optimized kernel is slower because the workload is compute-bound, and the overhead of shared memory and synchronization outweighs the benefits of reduced global memory accesses. The naive kernel's simplicity and efficient global memory access patterns make it faster on modern NVIDIA GPUs with high memory bandwidth and low latency.

For memory-bound workloads or GPUs with higher global memory latency, the optimized kernel would likely perform better. Further testing and profiling with different workloads can help determine the best approach for specific use cases.
